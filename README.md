votecounts.html - Simple HTML calculator to track the results of election between two candidates, 
as the votes are still being counted (as it happened in US Presidential elections in 2020).

- If one candidate is trailing, and if you guess the remaining uncounted votes, you can then find out
how much percentage of the remaining votes the trailing candidate needs to win.

- If one candidate is trailing by a certain number of votes, and if you guess the percentage of votes that the trailing candidate will get of the remaining uncounted votes, you can then see how many votes would have to be there for the trailing candidate to win.
